* There were 4,481 5 star Vine reviews and 3,035,639 non Vine 5 star reviews.

* There were 44.5% of 5 star reviews for Vine users and 62.7% of 5 star reviews for non-Vine users.

### Summary

The data shows that there is no positivity for bias for reviews in the Vine program because there are more non-Vine users giving 5 stars reviews than Vine users.
An additional analysis that could be done with the dataset would be to analyze the one star reviews and see if there is a tendency for Vine users to rate low compared to non-Vine users.
